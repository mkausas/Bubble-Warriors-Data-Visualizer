Bubble-Ai
=========
Goals:
- create a simulated war environment using small bubble AI
- the opening window should be a selection pane with which number of troops should be decided
- create different teams with different strengths; ex. USA (powerful artilery), terrorists (kamikazees), aliens (fast healers)
- have multiple different types of players (fighter, medic)
- be able to create your own custom team
- during gameplay when players shoot, heal, etc. have them animate somehow
- add sounds?

Cool add-on ideas:
- have armies based on web gathered information (visualize data through the simulation)
